# v18.6.1 Forge Fix Final Report

## Status
**Partial Success**. The `hillium-forge` container infrastructure has been upgraded and fixed, but `llama-cpp-python` compilation remains blocked by upstream source/toolchain issues.

## Completed Actions
1. **Dockerfile Update**: Added `ninja-build` to `infrastructure/docker/Dockerfile.forge`.
2. **Container Rebuild**: Successfully rebuilt `hillium-forge` image with new dependencies.
3. **Config Fix**: Corrected `workspace_path` in `.levitate.yaml` from `/workspace/hillium-core` to `/workspace`, resolving `OCI runtime exec failed` errors.
4. **Validation**: Verified `ninja` and `cmake` availability in the new container.

## Known Limitations
### `llama-cpp-python` Compilation Failure
Despite adding `libopenblas-dev`, `cmake`, and `ninja-build`, and upgrading `pip` to v25.3, the installation of `llama-cpp-python` fails during the `cmake` build step with:
```
ninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.
...
warning: writing 16 bytes into a region of size 0 [-Wstringop-overflow=]
```
This appears to be a compatibility issue between `llama.cpp` source code and the GCC version in Debian 12 on ARM64.

### Workaround
The `.levitate.yaml` configuration has been reverted to use `--no-deps` for the `loqus_core` installation:
```yaml
setup_commands:
  - "python3 -m pip install -e /workspace/loqus_core --break-system-packages --no-deps"
```
This allows Levitate to initialize the workspace and run `loqus_core` logic, though functionality depending explicitly on `llama_cpp` (like local inference) will not be available until the compilation is fixed.

## Next Steps (Recommended)
1. Investigate `CMAKE_ARGS` to disable `-Werror` or specific warnings for `llama-cpp-python`.
2. Consider using pre-built wheels for ARM64 Linux if available.
3. Or unpin/update `llama-cpp-python` version in `loqus_core/pyproject.toml` if a newer version fixes this.
