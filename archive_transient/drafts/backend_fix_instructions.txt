FIX FOR POWERINFERBACKEND MOCK MODE

PROBLEM: The PowerInferBackend mock mode implementation has three critical issues:

1. load_model() method in mock mode doesn't properly set internal state (self._is_model_loaded = True)
2. generate() method doesn't return results with '[MOCK]' text as expected
3. is_loaded() method doesn't return the actual internal state

SOLUTION:

In loqus_core/inference/backend.py, modify the PowerInferBackend class:

- In load_model(): When config.get('mode') == 'mock', set self._is_model_loaded = True
- In generate(): When config.get('mode') == 'mock', return '[MOCK] ' + prompt
- In is_loaded(): Return self._is_model_loaded (not a hardcoded value)

This will fix the test failures in mock mode functionality.
