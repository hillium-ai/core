# Contributing to the Hillium Orchestrator Core (HOC)

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Hillium. It‚Äôs people like you that will make the Kinetic AI ecosystem a reality. We are building this in the open, and we welcome any and all contributions.

## The Vision: Architecting in Public

We are in the foundational stages of building `HilliumOS`. Our current focus is on solidifying the core architecture and vision. You can read our full mission in our [**`README.md`**](README.md).

We believe in the principle of "architecting in public." This means that in these early days, contributions in the form of **ideas, strategic discussions, and feedback** are just as valuable as code.

## How to Contribute Right Now

The best way to contribute at this stage is to join the conversation.

### üí¨ Join our Discord Server
This is where the core team and community hang out. It's the best place for:
-   Brainstorming new `SynAppCore` ideas.
-   Discussing architectural decisions for the `LocusCore` and `Aegis Core`.
-   Sharing interesting projects and research in the Kinetic AI space.
-   **[Join the Hillium Community on Discord](#) (Enlace a tu Discord)**

### üí° Open an Issue
If you have a specific idea, feature request, or have identified a potential architectural challenge, please **[open an issue](https://github.com/hillium-ai/core/issues)**. We use issues as the public backlog for our roadmap.

We have templates to guide you:
-   **[Feature Request](https://github.com/hillium-ai/core/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=)**: For new ideas or capabilities.
-   **[Architecture Discussion](https://github.com/hillium-ai/core/issues/new?assignees=&labels=discussion&template=architecture_discussion.md&title=)**: For broader strategic or technical questions.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Code Contributions (Coming Soon)

We will be publishing our initial codebase and a more detailed contribution workflow (including code style, pull requests, and testing) as we approach our **v0.1** release.

For now, all code contributions should be discussed in an issue or on Discord first to ensure they align with the current architectural phase.

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to building a welcoming, inclusive, and inspiring community. All contributors and participants are expected to abide by our **[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**. Please read it to understand the standards we uphold.

We are thrilled to have you on this journey with us. Let's build the future of Kinetic AI, together.
